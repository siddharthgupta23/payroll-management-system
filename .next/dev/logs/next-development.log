[00:00:02.728] Server  ERROR   (node:16944) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///E:/payroll-management-system/next.config.js is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to E:\payroll-management-system\package.json.
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
